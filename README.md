# Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for time-series data
Turnkey and modular deep learning predictive modeling package for time-series data. It allows for univarate and multivariate time-series as well as single and multi-step forecasts. DNN models includes RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, hybrids, and more.



### Quick start

Step 1) Create and activate new env using `pipenv` or `conda` with Python 3.6 or higher. Here, the env is named `dts`.

`conda create -n dts python=3.6 && conda activate dts`

Step 2) Pip install `dnntime` package. It will automatically install or update the dependent packages.

`pip install dnntime`.

Step 3)
