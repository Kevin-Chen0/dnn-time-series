# Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for time-series data
Turnkey and modular deep learning predictive modeling package for time-series data. It allows for univarate and multivariate time-series as well as single and multi-step forecasts. DNN models includes RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, hybrids, and more.



### Quick start

Step 1) Create a new env using `pipenv` or `conda` with Python 3.6 or higher. In this example, the env name is `dts`.

`conda create -n dts python=3.6 && conda activate dts`
